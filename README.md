# Sneepe

This is an early version of my new desktop app. Sneepe is a simple manager to manage the code snippets hosted on Github Gists. You can easily preview, add, delete and sort your all gists. You can also put notes as markdown document. No additional databases are needed, all code snippets and configuration file are stored on Github.

All is built on Raect, Electron and Github API.

## Features

- snippets code highlighting
- live syntax highlighting
